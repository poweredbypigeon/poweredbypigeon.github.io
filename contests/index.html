                <p>One of my biggest hobbies has been the participation in contests. I feel like they get you to think strategically and learn beyond the school curriculum. </p>
                <p>I've historically participated in math contests, but I'm starting to do other contests (e.g. computer science). </p>
                <p>Some of my biggest wins have been: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>USAMO qualification (out of 336 people in total, and 20 people in Canada)</li>
                    <li>Placed on honor roll in every CEMC individual contest (Group I- Cayley, Group I- CIMC, Group III- Euclid to name a few)</li>
                    <li>University of Waterloo Avogadro Chemistry Contest- 7th in Canada, school champion</li>
                </ul>

<!-- click dropdowns, not hover ones. Use tutorial and learn more web evelompent sooner (freeCoeCamp, CSS? Maybe learn some more HTML) Need to learn XML, JSON, front end and back end web development and automated email.

Use Pranav Konda's site as an example

use x.com/blog instead of blog.html

Maybe use PHP to get absolute file path, for now have everything in one folder.

Flesh out computer / portrait tablet / portrait phone layouts.
