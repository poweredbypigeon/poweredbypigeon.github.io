                <h1>Weighing in on Adnan Syed's Trial</h1>
               <p class="subtitle">Sarah Koenig's podcast <i>Serial</i> shed light on a case from over a decade ago, sparking heated discussion. But what does it leave out?</p>

            <p>After reading the transcript from the podcast Serial, I felt like Adnan Syed should not have been convicted but I also knew that there was a lot of evidence that got left out. Therefore, I felt like I needed to research and tie up all the loose ends that did not get covered by the podcast. There was lots of evidence that I found online: some were against Adnan, some were for Adnan, but ultimately, I decided not to change my opinion. Here are three of the sources I came across: </p>

            1. <a href="https://www.adnansyedwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/UdA16-The-Im-Going-to-Kill-Note.pdf" target="_blank">The breakup note</a>

            <p>I came out of Serial believing that Adnan was innocent and that the podcast was slightly biased towards him.  For example, Koenig said Adnan had no one to call and Adnan did not look like a murderer. These statements are meant to build sympathy for him but do not say anything about how guilty he was. Therefore, to counteract this bias, I wanted to search for any evidence that went against my original conclusion. </p>

            <p>I focused on the prosecution’s case and I came across a piece of evidence from the trial that had been circulated on well-known documentary sites such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/3/11/18259534/serial-hbo-the-case-against-adnan-syed-review" target="_blank">Vox</a>: a breakup note from Hae Min that was found by police in Adnan’s home with “I’m going to kill” written on the back of it. The State used this to paint a picture of his motive: Adnan was possessive and jealous, and he was very upset when they broke up, and that was why he wanted to kill her.</p>

            <p>There is something more persuasive about a first-hand source of evidence.  Especially if it comes from a popular source such as Vox, I tend to trust it more.  As for the image itself, it had a few stains on it and an informal tone, which I think helped to personalize the letter.  This lent an air of authenticity to the letter, and as a result, was compelling to me.</p>

            <img src="/imgs/AdnanSyedNote.png">

            <p>However, I contest the relevance of this piece of evidence for two reasons: the first one is that the “I’m going to kill” phrase is taken out of context. If we look at the context of the words, the letter refers to Hae Min getting an abortion. Even though “I’m going to kill” is a sharp and inappropriate way to put it, my take is that Adnan was probably referring to their unborn baby and not Hae Min.</p>

            <p>Secondly, even if one accepts “I’m going to kill” as referring to Hae Min, in my opinion, it still does not build that much of a motive. Being a teenager, Adnan was likely momentarily upset about it and used hyperbole.  This is similar to how two people in an argument might say “I hate you forever” in the heat of the moment and then make up later. Given the passage of time after the letter was written, Adnan likely cooled down, and he did not do anything to act on it. I interpreted “I’m going to kill” as an exaggerated overstatement.</p>

            <p>Therefore, while the letter leaves me with the impression that it can be a persuasive and unbiased piece of evidence, I do not think it helps the State with their case.</p>

            2. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/12/29/exclusive-interview-jay-wilds-star-witness-adnan-syed-serial-case-pt-1/"  >An interview Jay did with The Intercept </a>

            <p>One area I wanted to research more on was everything surrounding Jay Wilds, because his testimony represented the bulk of the State’s evidence against Adnan. I found an interview from an alternative media source, The Intercept, which seems a lot clearer than the interview he gave for the police. The interview format helped me understand Jay’s side of the story more.  Like the breakup note, this is a firsthand recount of what happened, as compared to a news story from a distant reporter.  However, I learned that the Intercept as a news organization tends to engage in reporting that runs counter to the mainstream.  This gives me the impression that they are biased, and this causes me to be more skeptical of the information.</p>

            <p>For example, in the interview, I noticed that Jay changed his testimony on two key points. The first point was about the grave. In the police testimony as described by Serial, he said it took 20-25 minutes, but in the Intercept interview, he said it took 40 minutes. Another point was about when he saw the body. In the testimony, he said he saw Hae Min’s body at the Best Buy, but here he says he saw her body at 6 PM in front of his house. </p>

            <p>While these might be minute details, the inconsistencies suggest that Jay could be making up the story. This interview did not change my mind. In fact, it just confirms what I already suspected was true: Jay is an unreliable witness who changes up certain facts. In my research, I located <a href="https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/adnan-syed" target="_blank">another source</a> that states that “recent analysis of Wilds' police interviews suggests he had been heavily coached by the Baltimore police”. </p>

            3. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/01/serial-adnan-syed-new-trial-hae-min-lee-murder" target="_blank">Cell Phone Data from AT&T </a>

            <p>
            In terms of tangible evidence, there was not a lot of it presented in Serial.  Furthermore, Koenig glossed over some of the evidence that was mentioned. For example, she said, “According to Jay's story and the cellphone records, she was dead by 2:36 PM.”, without explaining how the records led to that conclusion.  I wanted to dig deeper into these cellphone records as Serial said they were used to reinforce Jay’s testimony but did not say much else about them.</p>

            <p>
            I found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/01/serial-adnan-syed-new-trial-hae-min-lee-murder" target="_blank">this article</a> from a mainstream media source, The Guardian.  In thinking about my potential biases, I trust these mainstream articles a lot because when I was growing up, I was accustomed to these as my primary source of information.  They seemed to cater to a wider audience and since they do not appear to display an overt bias, I feel like these sources are more reliable.</p>

            <p>
            The Guardian mentioned that the State used two pings from Adnan’s phone to determine his location, but a document produced by AT&T stated that the data was invalid. The article also said Adnan’s lawyer had that information on file but did not use it, suggesting that Adnan’s lawyer was incompetent. 
            </p>

            <p>
            This places doubt on all the cell phone records mentioned in Serial to find the exact time of death, which swayed my opinion even more towards Adnan’s innocence. Between this data and Jay’s testimony, it seems like the State intentionally used incomplete facts to prove Adnan’s murder. Without strong tangible evidence, and only relying on motive, I still believe that the evidence is not enough to certify Adnan as guilty.</p>
