                <h1>What's in a Name? Debating Dundas Street</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">There has been a lot of discussion about renaming Dundas Street after the racist actions of the person it was named after came to light. But is that the best solution?</p>
                <img src="/imgs/dundas-st.webp" style="width:700px;">
                <p>Would “a rose by any other name smell just as sweet?”. This line from Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet is often quoted to suggest that the name of something does not affect what that thing is. While the titular characters are supposed to hate each other because of their last names are from families that are sworn enemies, they do not care because they love each other. Shakespeare compares this with a rose: its name does not matter to most people, only its sweet smell does. Names are intended to give people a sense of what an object is but renaming something does not really change the function of the object. This type of question might appear a lot in philosophical debates, but it can creep up into daily life as well. </p>

                <p>
                <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-renaming-dundas-street-1.6103260" target="_blank">In 2021, the Toronto City Council voted to rename Dundas Street</a>, citing the racist past of Henry Dundas, the person it was named after, as he was a politician who was against ending the slave trade in the United Kingdom. (Draaisma). However, will the act of renaming this street, or by extension, anything with a racist name, actually change racism in real life? I do not think so, and here’s why. </p>

                <p>
                People are not in the habit of looking up the history of street names. Personally, although I loved looking at all the streets in my neighbourhood when I was younger, I just regarded the names as names. There are too many of them, such as: Dundas, King, Weston, Kennedy, Warden, Elgin Mills and Bloomington. If they do not know who the person is behind it and what they did, then the street names is meaningless and the inclusion of the person behind it is not spreading racism because no one knows what the significance of the name is.</p>

                <p>
                The cost and effort of a name change must be considered as well because it is not a simple matter. To officially change the name, it is necessary to change all street signs containing the name. Furthermore, this will have a knock-on effect on other things that must be changed (e.g., official addresses for people or businesses residing on Dundas Street, or store names that references Dundas Street). Collectively, this adds up to a substantial cost. <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8028570/toronto-city-council-dundas-street-renaming" target="_blank">Global News suggests that it could cost anywhere from $5.1 million to $6.3 million</a> (Patton).  Furthermore, this has and will continue to trigger significant political debate, which takes attention and time away from other important issues that require attention. So, while it might seem like a name change is easy to implement, there is a very real cost to this. </p>

                <p>
                Instead, this money and effort can be used in a more effective manner to tackle the root cause of racism. <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-657-x/89-657-x2020002-eng.htm" target="_blank">According to Stats Canada</a> (“Canada’s Black population: Education, labour and resilience”) , black people in certain regions of Canada are more likely to be unemployed and less likely to complete post-secondary education. Six million dollars goes a long way towards funding educational programs for underprivileged communities or providing business grants to those underprivileged communities. Furthermore, if the government has more time to focus on legislation or initiatives to directly deal with racism instead of a superficial name change, then the hope is that they can come up with measures that have more long-lasting impact on systemic racism. </p>

                <p>
                Another problem with superficial solutions is that people may think the problem is solved and move on to other causes.  Even allies have limited bandwidth to deal with issues of importance.  A name change is a good example of a performative, band-aid solution: something quick and easy that gives the illusion that the problem is solved. However, racism is a multifaceted, complex problem, and getting rid of “Dundas” risks oversimplifying the issue. Well-meaning activists may be successful in dealing with one small aspect of the problem, but this distracts everyone from bigger picture. Changing names do have some value, but they should come after everything else is done. 
                </p>
                <p>
                To be fair, there are many people who do know the history of Henry Dundas and are deeply affected by it.  There are those that feel traumatized by the mention of Dundas, and we should be sensitive to their experiences and viewpoints to be a more inclusive society.  I am sympathetic to the point that we should not honour and give evil people our respect and recognition. However, there are still reasons to not change the names of landmarks such as Dundas Street despite the pain and hurt that it causes some.</p>
                <p>
                While one could argue that keeping the name somehow signals society condoning these actions, cancelling the name does not achieve much either.  If Toronto simply deletes “Dundas”, Torontonians will forget what he did. There is some value in continuing to shine a spotlight on these bad activities and explicitly denouncing them to avoid any repeat of this in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                Keeping the name in Toronto’s identity can and should be used as a teachable moment. Kids might ask about that person, and then that could be used to explain Dundas’s wrongdoings. Or perhaps a plaque can be raised at Yonge-Dundas square showing the city’s continued condemnation of racism in all its forms.  The ultimate win would be to make Dundas’ name synonymous with anti-racism. He might not deserve to be famous but erasing his name from history would be a waste as the future generations can learn what he did. Continuing to focus on Dundas ensures what he did cannot be repeated again.</p>
                <p>
                In the end, instead of erasing racist figures, Canada can learn from them, refocus our energy in measures that direct tackle systemic racism, and save significant money and effort in the process. Communities often discuss healing but before that happens there is a wound that must be fixed. Once the underlying problems behind racism are solved, then names can be changed, and band-aids get placed so the community can finally recover.</p>
