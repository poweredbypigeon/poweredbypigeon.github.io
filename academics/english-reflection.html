                <h1>More Than Right vs. Wrong: Literary Theory Reflection</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">Real-life issues are more than just black and white, and the issues you tackle in high school English illustrate the point very well.</p>
                <p>When I read literature about conflict (and conflict with authority figures in particular), I struggled with understanding what motivated people to disagree which in turn impacted how I approached matters of personal conflict.  Reflecting on what I have learned from this course and my explorations of the post-colonial analytical lens, I can now connect better with the underlying causes of conflict both in texts that I read and in real life.  One of the revelations I have gained from my study of post-colonial criticism is that conflict with authority results from contrasting perspectives that stem from power imbalances and cultural differences.</p>
                <p>
                When it comes to unbalanced relationships, the stronger side controls the message or narrative, which can create resentment among the weaker party. In the poem <i>History Lesson</i>, Jeanette Armstrong implicitly references such an unequal balance of power: “Father mean well, waves his makeshift wand, forgives saucer-eyed Indians” (lines 8-10). Armstrong describes the colonists (through their religious leader) as forgiving the Indigenous people for behaviours that the colonists deem inappropriate. This demonstrates the colonial mindset: the Indigenous people need absolution for their wrongdoings.  The irony is that the Indigenous people see this from the opposite viewpoint, that the colonials need absolution for their mistakes. However, because the colonists have the power to control the message and represent themselves as the heroes (and hegemonize the Indigenous), this engenders resentment in the Indigenous people because that message is at extreme odds with what they feel and strongly believe. Although I can’t compare myself to what the Indigenous people have experienced, this feeling resonated with me as I considered my relationship with the people around me.  As a younger child, my parents would insist that I approach my learning and life in a rote fashion.  “Drill, drill, drill”, they would tell me, and for them, that was the only way to learn, instead of trying to think more critically or trying more novel methods of studying. Ultimately, I was forced to accede to my parents, and the fact that they always dictated the message created resentment from me because I felt my viewpoints were never heard. My parents always got their way, while I always felt unhappy. When the strong party tries to exert control over the relationship, that creates resentment, which leads to conflict.</p>
                <p>
                To solve this conflict, understanding that cultural differences cause the conflict between the parties and directly confronting them is critical to resolution. This is a common theme in <i>History Lesson</i>, which continually draws the contrast between the differences in viewpoints: “burying breathing forests and fields beneath concrete and steel” (lines 32-34). The colonists believe that by bringing their culture and way of life to North America, they are building civilization and creating progress and advancement in society.  The Indigenous see them as going against nature and destroying their culture, identity, and homeland. Both sides believe they are on the right side and the other is in the wrong, which is why a conflict arises. Reflecting on my relationship with my parents, the exact same thing occurs. Their viewpoint and approach to life were shaped because they grew up in a very different world, and the impact of that culture permeates their way of thinking.  In my exploration of post-colonial themes, I’ve realized that one not only needs to understand that a conflict can be viewed from different perspectives, but also needs to address the cultural differences that promote these different viewpoints in order to resolve the conflict.  If I don’t try to understand where my parents are coming from and never effectively articulate my perspectives, we can never come to a resolution or compromise. If we do achieve understanding, however, we build a bridge and stop the power struggle.</p>
                <p>
                By studying post-colonial literary criticism, I now understand how deep conflicts can arise from the differing viewpoints of the parties in a power-imbalanced relationship.  It has taught me to dig deeper and ask questions to understand what about the person’s culture and background colour their way of thinking and not just dismiss their perspective as a power trip.  I will also recognize that they might not be able to understand my viewpoint because they don’t understand my culture and beliefs, so I will endeavor to articulate them more assertively.  By understanding where each other is coming from, we can collectively create a deeper understanding to find a more harmonious resolution to conflict.</p>
