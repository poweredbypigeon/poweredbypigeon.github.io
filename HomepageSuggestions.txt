home page:

latest updates bar on the side, could randomize a quote every day

latest page should give you updates and new blog posts

make it more colourful (have a defined colour scheme)

put "Hi, I am Avery" in about and talka bout self  

advertise blog on front page- give example posts.  

Make projects a separate bar, what should bar look like?

(could include a progress bar on some future projects) 

Put STEM -> Projects

ACADEMICS -> (tips for school / helpful study materials / contests), books 

math team

contests material -> contest solutions

Or maybe BLOG / WRITING -> SCHOOL (tips for school / helpful study materials or apps / contests, tips for different courses), LIFE (interesting things I found, puzzles, stuff I've been doing or how I'm studying (for math contests), grades discussion, book reviews [To Build A Fire, Station Eleven, (self improvement/world books), etc.]), CONTESTS
(e.g. blog on a subject, solve an interesting math problem) )

could have an overview of some categories. 




more changes: (reorganize Blog Plan.docx to incorporate for small changes)

make icon transparent. 

add 404 page

have an indexing system for blog for now (until I can make it more advanced)

(remove resume) 

/blog.html -> /blog/index.html, use howardhalim.com for pathing 

make icons 35px

AFTER U STUFF:

The English blog post- more negative stuff 

(Could have a private blog section for myself where I discuss political stuff / English blog posts so no one sees it)

e.g. review of self improvement books, my true self


<e.g. review of OneNote, etc. could even advertise my own notetaking ssystem "NOTE TAKING SYSTEMS: THE GOOD & THE BAD">
<review of all my classes, tips to study them, etc. Like my "HS Progress Report" but without the final marks>

("well-rounded": study stocks/business/finance, alongisde academic STEM and industry led subjects like engineering (robotics)/medicine/etc.

and then personal stuff like sports/building/etc. )

(Wait But Why blog posts: talk about new technologies (do research on industry trends). but avoid politics)

(mathcsr.org delve into subjects)

(A MIT OCW- type learning plan, goepigen. Could include stuff like "Blockchain and Money")

(make best blog posts videos, e.g. "A Review of Grade 11 Biology in Under 32 Minutes")



"HOME", "ABOUT", "BLOG" (academic (e.g. school tips), STEM (e.g. contest studying, MIT OCW), business (e.g. metaverse thoughts- have 2-3 posts), misc (life stuff)) , "PROJECTS", "CONTESTS" (math team, contest solutions, "contest advice") as a featured blopost. 

OTHER THINGS:

early admission- do you receive an ya davantages if your app is in February? Are you selected fo rscholarships only out of that pool?

How many people get accepted in Feb vs May? Are you a straggler? When are the rounds of acceptance?

THeRoadToEngineering.com says There is no advantage to being selected early. 

People apply to MIT because: "If you apply early action, you do have a slightly better chance of getting accepted. According to MIT's admission statistics, if you apply early action, you do have a slightly better chance of getting accepted than if you apply regular action."

well rounded- does it work? (e.g. AIF) it seems like it's more about "what are your goals and why will program X help you?"

talk about how I won't always agree, and sometimes I look at what other people do (as they might know more or be more specialized in terms of websites, doing my research). 

other tips for personal websites all mention a blog <- don't think is right in terms of that. 

Didn't agree with the fact that they would skip over the blog, as .

does individual selection make a difference (seems liek they stop caring at marks past mid-90's, but waterloo says they accept more people with a certain average based on a graph. The model gives 100% acceptance at 100% average, which makes no sense)
