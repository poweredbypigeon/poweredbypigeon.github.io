                <h1>If You Can't Take the Heat: Moral Analysis of <i>To Build A Fire</i></h1>
                <p class="subtitle">Despite being less than 20 pages long, this short story offers a potent narrative about overconfidence, especially when facing something you don't know much about. </p>
                <p>Have you ever come across a challenge that was harder than it looked? In that case, you might relate to this story of a man hiking across the Yukon trail. While trying to get back to a camp he feels cold, and he tries to start a fire to warm himself but that fails, and he eventually dies of hypothermia. The death of the man in Jack London’s <i>To Build a Fire</i> illustrates the moral lesson that one should not overestimate oneself and simultaneously underestimate others, especially
                when facing forces you don’t know.</p>
                <p>A proper moral analysis requires looking at the book and figuring out: if the book has a message,
                if the message is positive and how effective the author is at teaching it. For example, in this
                novel, the man has no name, which might indicate that this story’s message could apply to
                anyone, which increases how effective the story might be.</p>
                <p>To start off, the man overestimates his own abilities, showing off lots of overconfidence. The
                most prominent example is his level of preparation. He doesn’t seem to have brought any special
                clothing to deal with the extremely cold weather: “50 degrees below zero meant a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by
                the use of mittens, ear coverings, warm moccasins, and thick socks. 50 degrees below
                zero was to him nothing more than 50 degrees below zero” (p.2),
                taking the temperature as an afterthought. The text elaborates, “Actually, he carried nothing but
                the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief.” (p.3), stating that he did not have any specialized gear
                (he later regrets not having a nose guard to protect himself). This just shows how flippant the
                man is, as if he is too good to wear any protection or he believes he doesn’t need to.</p>
                <p>
                He also didn’t have a companion, who might have pointed out some of the mistakes that he
                makes and might have inspired him to be more observant. This leads to his downfall when he
                builds a fire under a snow-covered tree because “it had been easier to pull the sticks from the
                bushes and drop them directly on the fire” (p.10). The snow falls from the tree and extinguishes
                the fire, and then he reflects on how having a companion would have helped him.</p>
                <p>
                Speaking of mistakes, he makes a lot of them during the novel and he ignores a lot of warning
                signs. However, not once does it cross his mind to turn back. The first time he should have
                turned back was when on page 8, “Already all feeling had gone from his feet.”. However, it is
                possible that out of a desire to complete the journey, instead of admitting the journey was
                miscalculated and trying again with better preparations, he risks his life to prove himself right.
                After he inevitably freezes to death, he still shows signs of overconfidence: “It certainly was
                cold, was his thought. When he returned to the United States he could tell the folks what real
                cold was.” (p.13). While he acknowledges that it is cold outside, he sees it as nothing more than
                a bragging right. The man refuses to acknowledge his mistakes or act cautious, and ends up
                dying, showcasing the dangers of overconfidence.</p>
                <p>
                Secondly, the man discounts everyone around him. Early in the story, he recounts an experience
                where a “man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got
                in this country. And he had laughed at him at the time!” (p.6). Despite being a newcomer to the Yukon, he discounts an old man’s advice without even considering to check whether the man’s
                advice is true. Later in the novel, the man calls the old man “womanish” for suggesting that he
                should not travel in 50 below zero weather (p.9) after building a fire. Ironically, his fire gets
                extinguished soon after that, and by the end of the novel, his last words are, ““You were right,
                old fellow. You were right,” he murmured to the old man of Sulphur Creek.” (p.16)</p>
                <p>
                He also discounts the dog he carries with him. While the dog may not know about temperature or
                clothing, it has instincts: “The animal was worried by the great cold. It knew that this was no
                time for traveling. Its own feeling was closer to the truth than the man’s judgment.” (p.3). At one
                point when he is desperate, the man believes that he can kill the dog and use it as shelter to warm
                up his hands, but the dog seems to notice: “Something was wrong and it sensed danger. It knew
                not what danger, but somewhere in its brain arose a fear of the man. ” (p.13). This, along with
                the fact that the dog ends up surviving and making it back to the camp, suggests that although it
                might not be capable of rational thought, it can still be very smart.
                </p>

                <p>
                Most importantly though, he seems to underestimate the power of nature. It is already mentioned
                that he continues despite the weather and the frozen lake. This is also likely because he doesn’t
                feel like it can do anything to him. On page 2, the novel says, “Such facts told him that it was cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did
                not lead him to consider his weaknesses as a creature affected by temperature.”
                He takes these statements as facts, but does nothing about it, suggesting he doesn’t fully
                understand the gravity of the situation. Throughout the novel, until the end the man adopts a
                lackadaisical attitude towards dealing with nature. Another example is when he gets his feet wet,
                and instead of focusing on his feet freezing, he seems to be more concerned about the delay in
                his travels:
                “He was wet to the knees before he got out of the water to the firm snow. He was angry
                and cursed his luck aloud. He had hoped to get into camp with the boys at six o’clock, and this
                would delay him an hour. ” (p.8)</p>
                <p>
                He only starts taking things more seriously once his second fire is extinguished, calling it a
                “judgement of death” (p.10). This statement proves true as his hands are too cold for him to build
                a fire or even kill the dog, showing how it is already too late for him to survive. After
                underestimating everyone around him and not caring enough about life, he has doomed himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                Next, he is oblivious to the world around him. For most of the novel, his concern is not on
                making the journey safely but what happens when he will get to “his boys”. He doesn’t seem to
                pay much attention to how cold it is, and seems preoccupied with trivial concerns such as lunch
                (“He smiled contentedly to himself as he thought of those pieces of bread, each of which
                enclosed a generous portion of cooked meat”) (p.3) and takes off his mittens.
                </p>
                <p>
                The novel points out his “lack of imagination” on page 2: “The trouble with him was that he was
                not able to imagine. He was quick and ready in the things of life, but only in the things, and not
                in their meanings.”. This is evident when he doesn’t seem to understand the environment around
                him and underestimates nature. For example, “cold”, “50 degrees below zero”, “uncomfortable”
                and “wet feet” are just words to him and don’t seem to bother him. His general lackadaisical
                attitude shows that being overconfident when faced with unknown dangers is a very bad
                combination.
                </p>
                <p>
                In conclusion, you should never be too overconfident and dismissive of others when you are
                faced with something you don’t know. The man handles his trip very badly, not preparing or
                listening to any advice before the trek, thinking of other things while on the trip and only taking
                things seriously when it is too late.</p>
                <p>
                Additionally, there are many parallels between this one and the pandemic. The environment
                represents the virus, and the man represents the people that refuse to listen to medical experts, do
                not have enough personal protective equipment, go outside and inevitably get infected. There are
                many people who overestimate themselves and underestimate others when dealing with this
                pandemic. Despite being over a century old, it can still teach us a powerful lesson: do not
                overestimate yourself or underestimate anyone else.</p>
