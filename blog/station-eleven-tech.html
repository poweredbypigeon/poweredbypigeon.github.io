                <h1>The Importance of Technology in <i>Station Eleven</i></h1>
                <p class="subtitle">Art is one big theme in Station Eleven, but technology is close behind- </p>
<p>When reading Station Eleven from an archetypal perspective, it becomes clear that technology is an important theme in the book, and the author uses common archetypes to make a statement about how society takes technology for granted.</p>  
 <p>
In the Georgia Flu timeline in Station Eleven, the characters have lost access to modern technologies which fundamentally change their lifestyles. Mandel imbues the characters with archetypes that further her views on technology. For example, she gives Clark the mentor archetype, a figure that imparts wisdom to other, younger people. The book states that “He always tried to explain it all anyway, whenever anyone asked about any of the objects he had collected over the years, from the airport and beyond—the laptops, the iPhones, the radio from an administrative desk, the electric toaster from an airport-staff lounge, the turntable and vinyl records that some optimistic scavenger had carried back from Severn City” (p.210). He made a Museum of Civilization to showcase all the technology from the old world. Mandel gives specific examples (such as an electric toast) and highlights that other people have joined him in this project, showing how he is an inspiration to everyone, which fits his archetype. In this way, Clark teaches children (who were born after the Georgia Flu) about the power of technology and how they should learn to treasure it. A mentor is a powerful tool that an author can use to convey their beliefs: by putting them in a voice of a character that is accepted as providing sage advice. Mandel, therefore, uses this to teach the reader the same, important lesson: technology is like a treasure.

Mandel does not limit archetypes to characters but also uses symbolic ones, such as the small town, to highlight the importance of technology. In literature, small towns are presented as insular, backwards, and exclusive - they reject outsiders as uncultured, and by extension, they reject outside ideas as they stick to old traditions, which leads to stagnation. They serve as foils to the big city archetype: big cities have bright lights and shiny skyscrapers, which represent innovation and progress. People go to big cities to grow and prosper, whereas people go to small towns to retire or go off the grid (to avoid the big city). In the story, small towns are commonplace: “Civilization in Year Twenty was an archipelago of small towns. These towns had fought off ferals, buried their neighbors, lived and died and suffered together in the blood-drenched years just after the collapse, survived against unspeakable odds and then only by holding together into the calm, and these places did not go out of their way to welcome outsiders. ” (p.49-50). Mandel talks about small towns, and how their experiences have driven their inhabitants closer together and given them a common hatred for the outside world. Not only did society seem to regress back a thousand years due to the lack of electricity and technology, but people’s attitudes towards technology have also changed. This causes a feedback loop in these towns: the more the town regresses due to the lack of technology, the more it rejects technology, which further insulates them, and causes it to regress even more. An insulated community is the perfect breeding ground for cults (which do not associate with anyone on the outside) which is likely why the Travelling Symphony encountered a cult in a town they performed in (p.60). Through the archetype of a small town, Mandel illustrates how much of an effect lack of technology has: not only are people unable to connect with anyone they want anymore, they are actively choosing not to do so, resulting in the devolution of society.

The Rogers internet outage of July 2022 had a great impact on the Greater Toronto Area (and it only took away the internet, much less all technology), and it showed that technology is deeply ingrained in people’s daily lives, and taking it away can easily stall so much of modern civilization’s progress.  Throughout the novel, Mandel artfully uses character and symbolic archetypes to make this exact point and emphasize the importance of technology to society, giving the reader a clear warning about taking it for granted.
