                <p class="subtitle">High school English is a course everyone has to take- and that's honestly for the better. </p>
                <p>If you’re an Ontario high school student planning to go to university, you’ve probably reviewed the requirements for your program. It turns out that university English is required for almost every program, no matter what subject you’re planning to study. At some point, you might have asked yourself, “Why do I need to take that? I’m studying subject XYZ, not pursuing a degree in English literature!”. However, I believe that it is important and should be required to enter all university programs. It teaches you how to apply many soft skills that are very important for university- and life as well!</p>
                <p>First, English teaches you how to think critically. For example, if you’re analyzing a book, you might need to come up with a meaning, theme, or literary device of a certain chapter. It is simple to read the words an author puts on a page, but harder to understand what the author is trying to say. You need to think critically about the context in a book (e.g. historical analysis, life and background of the author) to capture the true meaning and intent behind those words. This skill is also very important to come up with arguments for writing a persuasive essay. You might have all the knowledge in the world, but you’ll need to know how to think critically to turn that knowledge into ideas.</p>
                <p>Another thing English teaches you is how to communicate with others. If I had to summarize the key lesson of studying English in a single word, it would be: “communicate”. To be successful in class, you need to take your ideas and learn how to use literary techniques to convey them in the most persuasive manner to get your point across. It isn't just the words themselves. It is how the words make people feel.</p>
                <p>Finally, studying more English and reading more novels will expand your vocabulary and your exposure to ideas. In this way, it makes you even better at communicating. This has numerous benefits: it allows you to understand more about the world around you, it cultivates your mind, and makes you a more cultured person as you are in a better position to understand different people's viewpoints. All of those have applications in university where higher learning is focused on studying ideas and perspectives. Having a stronger background in turn will increase your success in any field of university, as well in life itself!</p>
                <p>One common complaint students have when talking about English is that if you are studying something technical like computer science, then there is no need to study English beyond a basic ability to read and write. I would argue that is a very superficial view. It doesn’t matter if you take the most advanced courses in university and come up with the greatest ideas if you can't communicate them. You may come up with the cure for cancer, but if you can’t explain why the cure works and why it’s so great, no one will give you the funding to develop that cure and your idea will be nothing more than an idea. Even on tests on scientific topics like chemistry or physics, you will need to explain your reasoning in a manner that tells the grader that you understand the materials. You've probably already come across that in a test: "Justify your answer." "Explain why".</p>
                <p>In conclusion, no matter what major you choose, even if not directly related to the study of literature, English will serve as your bread and butter. You’ll be able to get much farther with your knowledge, which is why I believe that high school English should be a requirement for all university programs.</p>
