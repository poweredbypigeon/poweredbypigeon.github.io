                <h1>Survival is Insufficient: The Role of Connection in <i>Station Eleven</i></h1>
                <p class="subtitle">One of the central quotes in <i>Station Eleven</i> can be viewed from many angles- such as something that's growing increasingly important in today's world: communication.</p>
                <p>Humans are social animals, and societies are built around the connections they make. Societies thrive or crumble based on relationships between people. In <i>Station Eleven</i>, when the Georgia Flu kills most of the population, survivors are put through the ultimate test of whether they can build anything that lasts. When looking at <i>Station Eleven</i> through an archetypal lens, one of the main messages is that a deep connection between people is needed to forge a common purpose, which is necessary for building or rebuilding something stronger than what existed before.</p>
                <p>
                One such example is Arthur, one of the most important characters in the novel. He fits the tragic hero archetype. The American public views him as a smashing success because he is a lead actor in many different movies, and this is supposed to represent his heroic qualities. However, his shadow self exhibits a fatal flaw: he is mainly concerned about validation and fame, which prevents him from building emotional connections with others. On his last day, he ponders this and realizes “he had done some things he wasn’t proud of. If Miranda was so unhappy in Hollywood, why hadn’t he just taken her away from there? It wouldn’t have been difficult. The way he’d dropped Miranda for Elizabeth and Elizabeth for Lydia and let Lydia slip away to someone else. The way he’d let Tyler be taken to the other side of the world” (Mandel 294). Each of these actions represents him neglecting the emotional needs of those around him. Arthur’s behaviour proves the converse of the book’s message: despite his success, he never finds a common purpose with anyone since he never develops any meaningful emotional connections with anyone in his life. He realizes this and tries to change himself, but he dies before he can do that. His story is tragic because he never gets to build the legacy that he wants. While people remember him after his death, they remember him for the wrong reasons. Arthur’s lack of connection ended up tainting his legacy.</p>
                <p>
                On the other end of the spectrum, the Museum of Civilization fits the death and rebirth archetype, which consists of a major transformation in response to a trigger event, which in this case is the Georgia Flu (211). The Museum’s stated purpose is celebrating the old world, but it also allows society to let go of the past as they are adapting to the future. While Clark curates the museum, many people have added to it: “There seemed to be a limitless number of objects in the world that had no practical use but that people wanted to preserve: cell phones with their delicate buttons, iPads, Tyler’s Nintendo console” (233) The objects in the museum (such as iPads) are symbols of the old world because they are useless without electricity.  The people have symbolically given up their focus on the past by giving up their things from that world.  The Museum is the vessel in which the personal connection between Clark and its donators grows. It creates that common purpose and understanding of the need to move on from an old world that no longer functions.  This allows the rebirth of the community into something stronger than what existed before.</p>
                <p>
                The Museum is in the Severn City Airport, which fits the small town archetype. Positive qualities of the small town include community and harmony, which the Severn City airport illustrates. Early on, the reader learns small towns “survived against unspeakable odds and then only by holding together into the calm” (50). Severn City Airport is no exception- they suffer many early setbacks, one such example being electricity going down and losing access to the outside world (223). However, they eventually find a common purpose of survival and persevere. They manage to replenish their source of food by hunting and grow their population to around 300 people (233). Once they found that common purpose of living, they started working together and were not only able to survive but prosper. 
                Mandel uses archetypes in <i>Station Eleven</i> to show that deep connections with others are needed to build a common purpose, and eventually a meaningful, enduring society.  The examples of the Museum and the Severn City Airport demonstrate that as long as people are interrelated and have a common purpose, they can overcome anything.  Conversely, the inability to connect results in tragedy.  This is an important lesson for today’s world, as modern technology allows for more connections but ends up creating superficial connections that never allow people to find that common purpose.  This is a warning about what is happening to society, but also a guide as to how to improve it.</p>
