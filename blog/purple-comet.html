                <h1>My Experience At The Purple Comet 2023 (York Region Math Circle)</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">We scored 2nd among high school mixed teams in Canada- here's how we did it. </p>
                <p>I decided to assemble a team for the Purple Comet Math Meet, an international team math contest event that took place in late April 2023. I wanted to do this because I had assembled a team for the Canadian Team Math Competition and I had really enjoyed that experience.</p>
                <p>I created the Purple Comet initiative through the York Region Math Circle, an organization that aims to promote interest in contest math and team-based math activities throughout the York Region, and assembled a team.</p>
                <p>Working together was fun, but I’m really proud of our performance in the actual contest! Despite being two members down, we did pretty well in the contest, placing 2nd in our division in Canada, with 21 questions out of 30. In my opinion, the last 10 questions were somewhat easy to do.</p>
                <p>I really think this would inspire more people to join team-based math activities, showing that anyone can become good at math if they try hard enough, and I’m hoping to expand YRMC’s operations in the future, to give more opportunities to kids in the region.</p>
