                <h1>Power Dynamics and the Narrative of <i>Station Eleven</i></h1>
                <p class="subtitle">How do gender dynamics affect the course of the story? Turns out everything leads back to one specific character.</p>
                <p>When examining the novel <i>Station Eleven</i> by St.Emily John Mandel from a feminist lens, it becomes clear that the growth of female characters are limited by men, whether it be wittingly or unwittingly.</p>
                <p>
                This is evident in the main character, Kirsten Raymonde. While she certainly has noble aspirations to bring the world back to life via art, throughout most of the novel, her dominant trait is that she is interested in learning everything about one man: Arthur Leander. This demonstrates the novel’s phallocentric narrative: even the main character seems secondary compared to a man. The book narrates that “there were countless things about the pre-collapse world that Kirsten couldn’t remember—her street address, her mother’s face, the TV shows that August never stopped talking about—but she did remember Arthur Leander, and after that first sighting she went through every magazine she could find in search of him” (Mandel 43). This symbolizes that she cannot move on from her old life or forget the things she cannot change. The novel notes down many things that most people do remember that Kirsten does not such as one’s address or parents, and contrasts this with Arthur, placing his presence above all of those things. This symbolizes that she cannot move on from her old life or forget the things she cannot change.  Arthur Leander is so important to Kirsten that she is still obsessed with him even though he is dead and he is even more important to her than her family. The author could have developed more of Kirsten's character independently of Arthur, but interestingly chose not to.  For example, the text referred to the two black daggers on her hand but gave no further mention of them, and the book could have focused on her journey and how the post-Georgia Flu world changed her, but did not. Unfortunately, St. John Mandel reduces her to a stereotypical fan of an actor, limiting her personal growth as she spends time clinging to the world she once knew instead of developing as a person. While Arthur did not do anything intentional to impact Kirsten, he does inhibit her character development quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                Kirsten’s situation can be compared to another example of a woman being limited by men: Miranda Carroll. Her early life is tumultuous. Her first boyfriend, Pablo is abusive and controlling, even though she is the breadwinner in the family. For instance, he attacks her for working on the Station Eleven project: “When sober, he suggests that she’s squandering her talent. When drunk, he implies that there is not much there to squander, although later he apologizes for this and sometimes cries. ” (Mandel 83). The book uses parallelism to highlight the differences between when Pablo is sober and when he is drunk, but it states that he does not like Station Eleven. Right away it does not seem like he wants to help her with her ambitions. He later physically abuses her (Mandel 93). This paints Pablo as a misogynist who believes that she should sacrifice her ambitions to help him and that he needs to keep his girlfriend in line. Later in the story, she marries Arthur, but she feels out of place with his Hollywood lifestyle, portrayed by her wanting to leave a party (Mandel 88). The relationship seems to be taking a toll on her because she does not feel like she’s in her element, and she would rather go back to Neptune Logistics. After Arthur cheats on her, she does exactly that. She never dates anyone after that and becomes a successful executive at Neptune Logistics while still working on Station Eleven. She declares, “I repent nothing” (Mandel 101), as she has been able to independently accomplish a lot, and grow without needing a man. While showing many examples of women not being able to grow due to their fixations on male characters, St.John Mandel did show an example that shows how a woman can grow on her own.</p>
                 <p>
                In conclusion, there are many different characters and relationships in the novel that show how the female characters in the novel are usually limited by their relationships with male characters, when looked at through a feminist lens.  Emily Mandel portrays this with men who have indirect effects and men who have direct effects.  The author appears to be very intentional with these elements, which indicate the statement St. John Mandel is trying to make.
