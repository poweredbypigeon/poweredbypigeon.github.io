                <h1>General advice for anyone doing contests</h1>
                <p>There are many people who have struggled to do well in math contests. Here is my advice to them: (this can apply to contests in other subjects as well:) </p>

                <p>Obviously, the most important piece of advice is to keep practicing by doing past contests. While school math does help you with contest math, it mostly only covers algebra and some geometry. Contest math also requires study of subjects like combinatorics and number theory that aren't taught in the curriculum, so you will need to study these. Doing past problems also helps you get a feel for what contest math problems ask for (for example, the CEMC contests tend to have a slightly different feel compared to the AMC), and you can assess your current "level".</p>

                <p>It's never too early to start, but it's also never too late if you are passionate about studying math. </p>

                <p>What's also important is to learn from each practice you do (I remember when I was less experienced I did past AMC 8 after AMC 8, didn't look at the problems I couldn't get, and as a result, I never improved). If your goal is to be able to understand problems 21-25 on the AMC and you can't get those correct, then you should try and look at the solution, try to understand why the solution author did the things they did (if you can't figure it out, ask a teacher or a friend). </p>

                <p>If the solution uses some concept you don't know, try to learn that topic through a book or a handout and do some problems.</p>

                <p>My third tip would be to revisit that problem later after reading the solution (say in a day or so) to test whether you can remember the main trick involved, but don't try and memorize the solution statement word-for-word- try to understand it!</p>

<!-- click dropdowns, not hover ones. Use tutorial and learn more web evelompent sooner (freeCoeCamp, CSS? Maybe learn some more HTML) Need to learn XML, JSON, front end and back end web development and automated email.

Use Pranav Konda's site as an example

use x.com/blog instead of blog.html

Maybe use PHP to get absolute file path, for now have everything in one folder.

Flesh out computer / portrait tablet / portrait phone layouts.
