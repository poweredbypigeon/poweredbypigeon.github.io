                    <h2>FEATURES</h2>
                    <p>Blackjack is a text-based game coded in Java, which I made when I was first learning how to use it. I coded this on the CodeHS platform, but I added some extra features on here.
                    </p>
                    <p>Obviously, it's based off the card game Blackjack, where you draw cards and try to get a sum of 21. You play against a dealer that hits on a sum of 17. </p>
                    <p>I was programming the project but I realized there were other actions like insurance, double down, etc. etc. so I decided to program those in, as well as some unconventional wins like a five-card charlie
                        (you automatically win if you draw 5 cards).</p>
                    <p>I also have a work in progress story line where you bankrupt the casino out of a billion dollars by cheating using these strange gadgets.</p>
                    <p>The idea actually came to me when I wanted to make a debugger to give myself a certain hand so I could test out all the features. I had fun with this project by injecting humour into the flavour text, so I imagined the debugger as this USB stick that shot out blue lightning, which led to the inclusion of other gadgets.</p>

                    <img src="/imgs/Blackjacode.png">
                    <p>In terms of programming, this taught me about object oriented programming and how to make multiple Java files communicate with each other.</p>

                        Some next steps I had in mind were: (in order)</p>
                    <p>
                    Version 1.1- Add more gadgets. I had a few ideas, like something that helps you card count. <br>
                    Version 2.0- Finish the storyline.
