<!-- <h1>Hi, I am Avery!</h1>

<!-- click dropdowns, not hover ones. Use tutorial and learn more web evelompent sooner (freeCoeCamp, CSS? Maybe learn some more HTML) Need to learn XML, JSON, front end and back end web development and automated email.

Use Pranav Konda's site as an example (and Ninjaclasher's) <- try to get the rows and rows of boxes. (flesh it out later to make it look more professional)

Also used the RHHS CS, and Howard's sites and everyone uses flex!

use x.com/blog instead of blog.html

Maybe use PHP to get absolute file path, for now have everything in one folder.

Flesh out computer / portrait tablet / portrait phone layouts. 

get used to site design.

Put content down then finish stylizing everything- JUST PUT DOWN THE CONTENT!!!!!!! (start at 9 PM)

resume- or just put down list of achievements


For the nav bar, once it's past a certain point, use JS to fix it (like the google search thing does)

Figure out a good way to use negative space and come up with a real color scheme.

By grade 12 end, I want to have a better site design (and also go more into server side dev)

I'm thinking sisdebar should be to the left. I would have it in the page for individual projects (maybe have it be rectangular and have a different bkgd color ), when searching for blog posts, as the table of contents for the blog posts, and I would give a slightly dfiferent look to each contest (and also link a certain contest to a blog post I had when doing the site)

SITE REVIEWS:

Howard Halim's site-

+ Good use of spacing and centering to make the icons look neat (30 px)
+ Enough whitespace so it doesn't look cluttered
+ Too much rounding on the buttons, but I like how they change on hover
+ Good use of a gradient at the top
+ Great use of a colour scheme (sticking to 1 colour, I might do 2)
Headings match the colour too.
+ Good font
+ Some content (table expressing goals,  handouts)

- No layout for phones

Pranav Konda's site-

+ Good use of icons
+ Good amount of content (book recommendations)
+ Nice resume

- Boring font
- Weird colour scheme & layout 

RHHS CS site-

+ Good font (even if it's like DMOJ)
+ Cool dark colour scheme, passable navbar
+ Once again good icon spacing in the footer (like Halim)

- Lack of content 


Ninjaclasher's site-

+ Good font (even if it's like DMOJ)- shines through in blog system
+ Great blog system- good use of icons
+ Icons on footer are good- centering them like everyone else. 
+ Nice resume
+ Lots of projects- I liked how there's an image previewing each one and the overall box layout of each
+ Heading shows you what tab you're on

- Boring color scheme and heading, but it doesn't need to be that complex
- Each project should have its own page

https://ryan10145.github.io/ has good blog with ToC and tags (especially when you have the listed by category section)
good layout (if it is a bit bland)

TODO: add AoPS to mine.

Dhruv's site, just to see what I can catch up on (e.g. the hardware element). Similar to Dhruv's site I could explore concepts (e.g. engineering, NLP, Markov Chains, etc.) <- Dhruv used virology for one project, Vivian used TensorFlow for another, I'm thinking I could dip myself into stuff like that. Dhruv also had a Scientific Computing with Python livestream, that seems great.

Even though the file is in "about-me" it can use file paths like that. So I could name everything ! 

"CONTEST ADVICE" leads to resources for various books (e.g. AoPS Intro to Geometry) such as notes, solutions to problems, hints to problems. The titles of the books will link to blog posts reviewing the books.
